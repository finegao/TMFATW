The ratios of the sides of a right triangle are called `trigonometric ratios`. Three common trigonometric ratios are the sine (sin), cosine (cos), and tangent (tan). These are defined for acute angle A below:

<mark>inverse trigonometric functions</mark>:In general, if you know the trig ratio but not the angle, you can use the corresponding inverse trig function to find the angle. This is expressed mathematically in the statements below.

> The expression  ![inverse trig functions](/images/2017091904.jpg)  is not the same as  ![inverse trig functions](/images/2017091905.jpg). In other words, the -1 is not an exponent. Instead, it simply means inverse function.
